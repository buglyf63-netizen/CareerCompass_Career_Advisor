## 🎯 The Problem: The Modern Career Maze

The modern career landscape is a confusing and often frustrating maze. Talented individuals face significant hurdles:

*   **The Resume Black Hole:** Over 75% of resumes are rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) before a human ever sees them, often due to minor formatting or keyword issues.
*   **Skill Gap Blindness:** Many students and professionals struggle to identify the *exact* skills they need to acquire for their target jobs, leading to wasted time and effort on irrelevant courses.
*   **The Guidance Gap:** Personalized, data-driven career advice is a luxury, leaving most people with generic recommendations that don't consider their unique personality or aptitude.
*   **Information Overload:** The sheer volume of job portals and online courses creates noise and analysis paralysis, making it difficult to find a clear path forward.

This leads to wasted potential, career dissatisfaction, and a significant gap between ambition and achievement.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

We've built CareerCompass.ai on a modern, scalable, and AI-native stack designed for performance and rapid innovation.

*   **Frontend:** **Next.js (App Router)** & **React** with **TypeScript** for a fast, type-safe, and responsive user experience.
*   **UI Components:** **ShadCN UI** & **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, accessible, and themeable design system.
*   **AI Framework:** **Genkit (by Google)** to orchestrate all AI operations, manage prompts, define data schemas, and call our models.
*   **Generative AI Model:** **Google Gemini** for all generative tasks, including resume analysis, report generation, chatbot responses, and flowchart creation.
*   **Backend & Database:** **Firebase** for our serverless backend, including **Firebase Authentication** for user management and **Cloud Firestore** for storing all user data (profiles, reports, progress).
*   **Hosting & Deployment:** **Firebase App Hosting** for scalable, serverless hosting of our Next.js application.

### System Flow

1.  **User Interaction (Frontend):** A user signs up and uploads their resume on our Next.js frontend.
2.  **API Call (Frontend → AI Layer):** The frontend triggers a server action that invokes a **Genkit Flow**.
3.  **AI Processing (AI Layer):** The Genkit flow sends the resume text and a structured prompt to the **Gemini API**, requesting analysis, career paths, and a learning roadmap.
4.  **Data Return & Persistence (AI → Frontend → Backend):** The AI-generated JSON response is sent back to the frontend. The client then saves these results to the user's document in **Cloud Firestore**.
5.  **State Update & Display (Frontend):** The results are also saved in our global **React Context**, and the UI updates to display the personalized recommendations on the user's dashboard.

## ⚙️ How It Works: The User Journey

1.  **Sign Up & Onboarding:** The user creates an account via email or Google Sign-In and lands on their personal dashboard.
2.  **Upload Resume:** The user uploads their PDF resume, which is instantly sent for AI analysis.
3.  **Take the Psychometric Test:** The user takes a short, AI-generated test tailored to their persona to reveal their personality and aptitude.
4.  **Get Recommendations:** On the Recommendations page, the user can view a detailed synthesis of their results, including recommended career paths, identified skill gaps, and a personalized learning roadmap.
5.  **Track Your Progress:** The user navigates to the Progress Tracker, selects a career path, and begins completing milestones, earning badges as they go.
6.  **Get Mentorship:** At any point, the user can chat with the **TechMitra AI** to ask questions, get advice, or find learning resources.
