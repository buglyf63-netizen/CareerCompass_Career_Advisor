### **Slide 2: The Problem**

**Title:** The Modern Career Maze

*   **Guidance Gap:** Lack of personalized, data-driven advice leads to career dissatisfaction.
*   **Information Overload:** Overwhelming job portals with no clear direction.
**Visual:** Four icons representing each problem: a resume going into a black hole, a question mark over a brain, a crossroads sign, and a storm of logos.

**Presenter Script:**
"The career journey today is broken. Talented individuals are getting lost in the 'resume black hole' due to automated filters. They are flying blind, unaware of critical skill gaps. The guidance they receive is often generic, and the job market feels like a chaotic storm. This leads to wasted potential and widespread career dissatisfaction."
